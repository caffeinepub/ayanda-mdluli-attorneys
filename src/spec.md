# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Refine the homepage UI by simplifying the hero CTAs and updating the visual design/interaction of the “Our Approach” and “How It Works” sections to match the site’s gold theme.

**Planned changes:**
- Remove the “Contact Us Today” button from the homepage Hero section, leaving only “Schedule a Consultation,” and clean up any now-unused handlers.
- Redesign “Our Approach” cards: replace numeric labels (1–4) with icons, set card backgrounds to white (remaining legible in dark mode), apply a persistent gold border using the existing gold/accent theme token, and add a subtle on-click upward-lift interaction without changing the border color on click.
- Update “How It Works” step layout so the step number appears outside/separate from the bordered text box (number first, then the card), and apply a gold border to each step card using the existing gold/accent theme token while keeping the section responsive.

**User-visible outcome:** The homepage hero shows a single consultation CTA, “Our Approach” cards use icons with a consistent gold-bordered style and subtle press interaction, and “How It Works” steps display their numbers outside the gold-bordered text boxes in a clean, responsive layout.
