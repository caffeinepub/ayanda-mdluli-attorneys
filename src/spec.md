## Summary
**Goal:** Add “Criminal defense” as an available selection in the Contact Us consultation form’s service selector.

**Planned changes:**
- Update the Contact page “Service You Are Booking For” accordion dropdown to include a new option labeled exactly “Criminal defense”.
- Ensure selecting “Criminal defense” closes the selector and populates the service field value.
- Ensure form validation recognizes “Criminal defense” as a valid selected service (no “Please select a service” error after selection).

**User-visible outcome:** On the Contact page, users can choose “Criminal defense” from the service dropdown when requesting a consultation, and the form accepts it as a valid selected service.
