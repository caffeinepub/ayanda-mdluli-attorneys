REQ-6 (Our Approach card redesign details) cannot be fully verified due to truncation of AboutApproachSection rendering/styling code; some parts (icon swap) are evident, but required styling/interaction behaviors are not directly shown.",

      "requirement": "Our Approach cards: white background, permanent gold border using existing accent/gold theme token (no border color change on click), and on-click subtle upward-lift interaction that returns on release (desktop/mobile).",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt for AboutApproachSection.tsx is truncated before the approach card JSX/classes are shown, so the required card background, border behavior across states, and click/tap lift interaction cannot be confirmed from the provided code.",
