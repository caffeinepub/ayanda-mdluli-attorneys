However, the actual image file was not added to a public static assets path in this diff (no added files), so the runtime asset requirement is not satisfied based on the provided changes.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Add the uploaded image `Law-firms1.jpeg` to the frontend static assets under a public static path (e.g., `frontend/public/assets/...`) so it is served at runtime without involving the backend.",
      "reason": "The diff summary shows \"Added: 0\" and no new asset file under `frontend/public/assets/...` (or similar). Although HeroSection references `/assets/Law-firms1.jpeg`, the image itself is not present in the diff.",
      "evidence": [
        "File diff summary header: \"Added: 0\"",
        "frontend/src/components/home/HeroSection.tsx (references `url(/assets/Law-firms1.jpeg)` but no asset file added)"
