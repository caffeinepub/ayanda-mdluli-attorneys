  "summary": "All three requested changes appear implemented in FinalCtaSection: the section background is set to the standard white/background token, the secondary \"Contact Us Today\" button is removed (with only a single primary button remaining), and the consultation availability footer text block is no longer rendered. However, the diff also adds decorative accent background elements that were not requested and may conflict with the “no redesign beyond” constraint.",
