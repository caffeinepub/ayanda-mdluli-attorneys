  "summary": "REQ-6 is implemented via an image preload hint in frontend/index.html, and REQ-5 appears implemented by preloading the existing Contact hero image via usePreloadImages in ContactPage while keeping the same image URL and background CSS classes. However, the diff evidence is truncated, so exact targeting of the specified XPath/section cannot be fully verified. Some unrelated/non-requested files were also modified.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-5",
      "requirement": "Apply the preload behavior specifically to the Contact Us page content at the selected element XPath (/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/main[1]/section[2]) so the hero background is visible immediately on reload without changing composition.",
      "reason": "The diff shows usePreloadImages is invoked in ContactPage and the hero background div uses the correct URL, but because ContactPage.tsx is truncated, it is not possible to confirm that the affected element corresponds to main > section[2] (the specified XPath) rather than a different section.",
