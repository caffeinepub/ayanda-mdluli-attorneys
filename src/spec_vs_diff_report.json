  "summary": "A new Phase 2 component (AboutApproachSection) was added under frontend/src/components/home/ and wired into HomePage.tsx immediately after TrustIntroSection, meeting the structural placement requirement. However, the visible copy in the new section appears to be newly authored placeholder/marketing text rather than the exact Phase 2 content referenced in the BuildRequest, so REQ-7 is not satisfied based on the diff evidence.",

      "requirement": "All visible text in the new About / Firm Overview + Approach section must match the Phase 2 content from the user’s original prompt exactly (no placeholder copy or invented copy).",
      "reason": "The new component contains detailed narrative and headings (e.g., firm description, experience claims, practice areas, and an approach tagline) that appear to be newly written rather than verified as the exact provided Phase 2 copy. The diff does not show the required source content, and the included text reads like invented marketing copy.",
